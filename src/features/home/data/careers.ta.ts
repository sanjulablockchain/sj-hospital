// Tamil for the home page's `#career` band.
//
// Four of the five `jobOpenings[*].title` values are the exact same open
// positions as four of `career`'s own six `jobs[*].title` values (see the
// header comment in content.ts), so they are read from `career`'s own
// `sharedJobTitlesTa`, exported through its `index.ts`, rather than a second
// copy of its already-reviewed Tamil typed out again here. That file's own
// header explains the per-title split between the occupational noun that
// stays English and the ordinary word that translates:
//
// - "Medical Officer, Emergency": translates "Medical", keeps "Officer" and
//   "Emergency" (a register word) English.
// - "Theatre Nurse": translates "Theatre" to "அறுவை சிகிச்சை அரங்கு" (reusing
//   navigationLabels.ta.ts's own "Operating theatres" root), keeps "Nurse"
//   English.
// - "Medical Laboratory Technologist": translates "Medical Laboratory" to
//   "மருத்துவ ஆய்வக", keeps "Technologist" English.
// - "Radiographer, Digital X-ray": KEEPS_ENGLISH in full, the same
//   register-word class as "Digital X-ray" itself.
//
// "Pharmacist (night shift)" is this page's own row, not one of career's six:
// "Pharmacist" keeps career's own KEEPS_ENGLISH precedent (a bare
// occupational noun with no ordinary word riding along), and "night shift"
// translates, keeping "Shift" English the same way career's own `jobs[*].line`
// keeps "Shift Roster" English throughout.
//
// `department` values reuse the site's own vocabulary: "Emergency", "Pharmacy"
// and "Imaging" are KEEPS_ENGLISH (see content.i18n.test.ts). Of the three,
// only "Pharmacy" actually has an entry in career's own `departmentLabels`
// (an English-identity key there); that map's own taxonomy is All / Medical
// / Nursing / Allied health / Pharmacy / Administration / Support services,
// with no Emergency, Surgical, Laboratory or Imaging entry at all, so
// "Emergency" and "Imaging" here rest on the site's independent
// register-word precedent (the same class as "Digital X-ray", "OPD" in
// navigationLabels.ta.ts), not on any match in that map.
// "Surgical" and "Laboratory" translate. "Laboratory" here uses "ஆய்வகம்" to
// match the word this same row's own job title already uses for "Medical
// Laboratory Technologist" rather than saying the same thing two ways on one
// row.

// See the header comment in careers.ts for why this is a relative import to
// career's own overlay file rather than through its `index.ts`.
